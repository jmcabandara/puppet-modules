Lullabot Puppet Modules
=======================

This repository contains puppet modules developed by Lullabot for internal
server management.

These modules are designed to be generic enough to use in various situations.
For easy installation, clone this repo to /usr/share/puppet/modules, which is
the default secondary location that puppet looks for modules.
